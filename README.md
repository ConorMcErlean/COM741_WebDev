# COM741_WebDev
Repository for work from the COM741 Module: Web Based Application Development

Code will primarily be in C# as I learn to use the dotnet platform.

Within each folder is the files used and created within the Lab session for that day.
The file structure and some of the code was provided, but the majority of the methods were created within the lab class.

Within the folders are ReadMe files created by the Lecturer.
