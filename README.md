# COM741_WebDev
Repository for work from the COM741 Module: Web Based Application Development

Code will primarily be in C# as I learn to use the dotnet platform.

Within each folder is the files used and created within the Lab session for that day.
The file structure and some of the code was provided, but the majority of the methods were created within the lab class.

Within the folders are ReadMe files created by the Lecturer alongside template files for each lab, normally forming the initial commit of each
sub project.

The Coursework project is primarily built by myself, so is likely the strongest indicatior of my Web Development abilities using the .Net framework. 

# The Requirements of the Coursework Project set out by the brief are:
1.	~~Browse through a list of vehicles~~
2.	~~Provide option to order list of vehicles by make, fuel type or date of registration~~
3.	~~View a specific Vehicle (selected by Id) displaying its details and associated list of service records~~
4.	~~Add a new Vehicle to the Fleet~~
5.	~~Edit an existing Vehicle (selected by Id)~~
6.	~~Delete an existing Vehicle (selected by Id) and its related service records~~
7.	~~Add/delete a service record to/from the currently selected Vehicle~~
8.	Providing suitable validation when creating/editing a Vehicle or adding a Service record.
