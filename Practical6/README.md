The solution contains 

Data project that 
1. defines the entity models with associated relationships  
2. defines a Repository Layer (EntityFramwork Context)
3. a Service Layer (application business logic)

XUnit Test project that
1. Defines a set of unit tests to validate the operation of the service layer 
2. Requires a reference to the SMS.Data project (dependency) - in particular the Service class and 
   models
